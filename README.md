Weather App inside your console

## Usage (Windows)

To use the CLI you need to download and add it to Path (to download CLI check the release note)

I suggest you to create folder C:\wea. Then, open cmd and run:

`setx /M path "%PATH%;C:\wea"`

After that, you need to restart your system. And that's all!
